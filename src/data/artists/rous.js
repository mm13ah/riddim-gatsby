  <p>Warren Rousseau aka Rous is a Kent-born DJ and
  producer. Rous has developed an impressive skillset in his short career,
  successfully carving out his brand and passion for all things drum and bass.</p>
  <p>With a rich background in metal and rock it was inevitable that music
  was going to play a pivotal role in Rous' future. Rous discovered drum
  and bass through Netsky's 'I Refuse' at age 13 and with his eyes and ears
  opened, he entered himself into the world of drum and bass. Since then
  he's co-founded one of the most exciting new labels Terra Firma, gaining
  support from across the scene.</p>
  <p>Rous is a formidable figure behind the decks having supported the likes
  of Halogenix, Loz Contreras, Plastician, Taiki-Nulight and many more.
  Rous is certainly no stranger to smashing up dancefloors.</p>
