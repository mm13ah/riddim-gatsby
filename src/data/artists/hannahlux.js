const info1 = `Self-taught singer, songwriter and musician,
  Hannah Lux, has been mesmerised by music her entire life and began writing
  her own at the age of 12; inspired by her colourful upbringing in Cardiff,
  the creative heart of Wales.`;
  
const info2 = `Lux continued to write and perform throughout her teenage years and her
  style continuously evolved until she was introduced to electronic music.
  Her first track was an ambient garage collaboration, 'Dangerous', under
  her previous pseudonym, Solis, which attracted attention to her unique
  vocals. She took this in her stride, working behind the scenes on varied
  pieces with producers from around the UK before releasing 'Go With Me' -
  an original song remixed by Boston on Symmetry Recordings. Lux then flew
  to Amsterdam and Poland to record and film for 'We are not Human' with
  June Miller on RAM Records under her new pseudonym, Hannah Lux. 'We are not
  Human' is featured on UKF's Youtube platform and quickly became a liquid
  favourite leading to its nomination for the Best Music Video Award at the
  Bass Awards 2015 and its Top-5 spot in the Beatport chart.`;
