const info1 = `Hailing from Cardiff, Max Scott aka Mascot began his journey into the world 
  of drum and bass at an early age. Gripped by the sounds of his inspirations 
  Ed Rush &amp; Calyx and Teebee, the Welshman's passion for music spilled over 
  into DJing in his early teens. Now recognized for his signature blend of deep n' 
  dark dnb, Mascot consistently brings an electric energy to his performances.`;

const info2 = `Mascot's versatility as a DJ has allowed him to support some of drum and bass's 
  finest and most established talents, notably; Alix Perez, Bou, Emperor, Hybrid 
  Minds, Kasra, Kings of the Rollers, Lenzman, Levela, LSB, Macky Gee &amp; Phantasy.`;

const info3 = `Pursuing his passion for the fast-paced genre even further, Mascot began designing 
  his own brand Riddim Records. The company launched in 2016 and has gone from 
  strength-to-strength to quickly become one of the UK's fastest growing independent 
  drum and bass brands. With performances across the UK and internationally, Riddim 
  Records has already left an imprint on the scene, laying a strong foundation for 
  future success with sights set high among the biggest and best drum and bass brands.`;
