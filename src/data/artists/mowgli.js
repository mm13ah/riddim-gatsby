  <p>For a relatively small city, Cardiff has churned out some incredible drum and bass 
    artists and Mowgli firmly holds his spot among some of the greatest. Drum and bass 
    has played a pivotal role in Mowgli's life, and, equally, Mowgli has played a pivotal 
    role in the shaping of the Cardiff drum and bass community. With his routes based in 
    dark rollers, and taking influence from a dark and tech-y sound, Mowgli brings a whole 
    new style to his sets.</p>
  <p>Joining the ranks of the Riddim Records artist collective in 2017, Mowgli has 
    represented the brand both up and down the UK and internationally, and will continue 
    to tear up dancefloors for the foreseeable future.</p>
