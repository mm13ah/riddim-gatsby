const info1 = `Hailing from London, Skinny has played across almost all venues in Leeds, so is no stranger behind 
  the decks. Providing a unique style of drum and bass that incorporates elements of minimal, half-time, 
  rollers and jungle, he has crafted a sound that brings out the raver in every listener. His influences 
  range from established artists across many genres, ranging from Alix Perez through to DJ Shadow and Mala. 
  His sound control and crowd reading allows him to bring out heavy and dark sets where needed whilst also 
  keeping the audience afloat with gentler liquid and technical minimal. When showing his experimental side, 
  he dips into unknown and old school fields of drum and bass to bring out his own hand-picked selections.`;

const info2 = `The roster of artists he has supported includes: Randall, DJ Hype, DJ Hazard, Ed Solo, Nicky Blackmarket, 
  Gold Dubs, Benny L, Annix, Aries, Sub Zero, Serum, Dillinja and many more. In supporting these artists 
  he has picked up unique skills that have allowed him to curate powerful sets that guarantee enjoyment.
  As well as having an ear for drum and bass, Skinny also delves into 140 dub â€“ engaging in multiple projects 
  with close friends and musicians curating new styles of dub and producing experimental sounds.`;
