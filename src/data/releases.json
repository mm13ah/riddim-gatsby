Collating the sounds of three of the most promising up-and-comers the drum and bass scene has right now in an action-packed, 3-track E.P under the title Episode 1 ('Ep. 1'). RR's first release hopes to show the diversity that Riddim Records strives to push forward through working with tracks from across the drum and bass spectrum.", "The E.P. begins with the sounds of Leeds-based artist Dbrief, who sets us up with his track \"All The 9's\". The track infuses a clear Jungle influence, coupled with a classic Hip-Hop groove. A fresh and recognizable track from the liquid specialist himself.", "The second track, created by artist Thread, reflects his unique and forward-thinking approach to drum and bass. 'Mindless' offers its listeners a dark and experimental journey that so perfectly describes its creators taste in the fast-paced genre.", "Ep. 1's final track comes from Norwegian artist Yassily. Inherently a techno artist, Yassily's creation 'Expression' provides something a little bit different to the E.P with his hard-hitting sound ending the E.P. with something to get your feet moving."],
