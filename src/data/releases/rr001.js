const info1 = `The team from Riddim Records have been working tirelessly behind the scenes 
  on their first ever release, and it's a big one. Collating the sounds of three 
  of the most promising up-and-comers the drum and bass scene has right now in 
  an action-packed, 3-track E.P under the title Episode 1 ('Ep. 1'). RR's first 
  release hopes to show the diversity that Riddim Records strives to push forward 
  through working with tracks from across the drum and bass spectrum.`;

const info2 = `The E.P. begins with the sounds of Leeds-based artist Dbrief, who sets us up 
  with his track "All The 9's". The track infuses a clear Jungle influence, 
  coupled with a classic Hip-Hop groove. A fresh and recognizable track from the 
  liquid specialist himself.`;

const info3 = `The second track, created by artist Thread, reflects his unique and 
    forward-thinking approach to drum and bass. 'Mindless' offers its listeners 
    a dark and experimental journey that so perfectly describes its creators taste 
    in the fast-paced genre.`;

const info4 = `Ep. 1's final track comes from Norwegian artist Yassily. Inherently a techno 
      artist, Yassily's creation 'Expression' provides something a little bit 
      different to the E.P with his hard-hitting sound ending the E.P. with something 
      to get your feet moving.`;
